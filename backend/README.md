# Restaurant Backend

This project is the restaurant backend.

It uses dotenv

Your dotenv file will need the following

- JSONSECRET=
- PORT=3001
- FRONTENDPORT=3000
- DIALECT=postgres
- PROTOCOL=postgres
- DB_URL=

Please remember to create your db user first.

Initially the project is set to drop and re-create the tables on every restart. Change this going forward for production.
